2. Address each comment by updating the code where it is relevant.
3. Publish a with "thumbs up" emoji, if change is approved or with a reason why the change request was rejected.
4. Mark conversations as resolved, if appropriate.
5. Generate a report table with stats: issues addressed, issues not-addressed, changes accepted, changes rejected, total reviewers.
